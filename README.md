### How to run this program:

Make sure to change the file path specified as shown by changing FILENUMBER with the corresponding test file in the Test_files directory.

```elixir
Regx.get_lines("./Test_Files/example_FILENUMBER.json", "template_page.html")
```

After that, run the program with the elixir commands of your choice, by either doing **elixir FILENAME.ex** or by activating the elixir interactive shell with **iex**. The provided html file will change according to the selected template file.
